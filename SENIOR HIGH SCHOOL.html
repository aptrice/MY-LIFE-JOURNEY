<h2 align="center">"MY SHS JOURNEY"<br></h2>

<p>Since I already knew a little about the world we live in and the importance of education, I experienced competitiveness during my senior year of high school. In an effort to show myself and have the best route for my college trip, I got dedicated in my studies. We all aim to do well in our studies, I know that. This year, the school hallways felt less like a chaotic maze and more like a welcoming space.  We had our own little world, a world filled with colorful threads, shared secrets, and the magic of friendship. That's why I made my senior high school life happy because of my senior high school friends, teachers, and, of course, my family, who became a strong foundation throughout this journey.</p>
