<h2 align="center">"MY ELEMENTARY JOURNEY"<br></h2>

<p>I would say that my elementary school years are among the happiest times in my life because, as children, you are unaware of or do not experience problems. However, during elementary school, there was a yearly event called a "field demo" where students from all grade levels competed in the field of dancing with a common theme. When I was in grade 6, the theme was Christmas, and it was my favorite of all because it was the most memorable event of my elementary school life because it was also my graduation. All I can say now that I am a college student enrolled in a BSIT course is that my elementary school years were the happiest days of my life, full of joyful memories that will always be treasured from my childhood. </p>
